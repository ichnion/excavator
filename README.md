## Installing Excavator

### Install the binary 
If you don't have Rust installed on your computer, this method is for you.
First click on "Releases" : 
(/img/img-1-install.png)
### Compiling from source
You need to have a [package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#package-manager) called [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) in your local.

If you already have got `rustc` installed in your local, you also have `cargo` installed locally.

And then you can install with this command.

```sh
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/ichnion/excavator --branch develop
```

### Install from crates.io
You can also install from package registry.

```sh
$ cargo install excavator
```

### Install from Homebrew
```sh
$ brew tap ichnion/tap
$ brew install excavator
```

### Update to the latest version
```sh
$ brew upgrade ichnion/tap/excavator
```

## How to use Excavator
Excavator read and store your exported digital data.
Currently, we support **part of** Google Takeout and Facebook data.

Once you specify the directory, for instance `Google Takeout`, excavator recursively find an applicable file and read the data.

```sh
$ excavator read ~/Downloads/Takeout // Downloaded Google Takeout directory
```

Or you can specify the single file
cargo install
```sh
$ excavator read Location History.json // A single file from downloaded Google Takeout
```

**Note:** To enforce Delete Cascade on tables with Foreign Keys in Sqlite, the following has to be set before deletions:

```
sqlite> PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```
